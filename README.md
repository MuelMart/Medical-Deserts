# A Spatial and Computational Analysis of Medical Deserts
This repository serves as the codebase for our CSE6242 final project.
>The objective of our research is to utilize an analytical approach to identify and understand the characteristics of medical deserts. We plan to achieve this task by leveraging American Community Survey 5-year Estimate data alongside Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data. With this data, we intend to calculate the number of family practice doctorâ€™s offices within a 25 km radius of each tract centroid in the country. A clustering model will be applied to the data to identify discrete groups that exhibit similar demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. tract poverty rate, median household income, etc.), as well as healthcare facility access. Additionally, the researchers will employ a regularized regression model to identify which socioeconomic / demographic characteristics are most important in determining the number of doctors within a 25 km radius of a tract. The final product will come in the form of an interactive map which displays which tracts are most vulnerable with respect to healthcare access alongside additional information regarding the demographic profile of said tracts. The hope is that this project can provide a new perspective to understanding the mechanisms through which inequity can perpetuate the hinderance of medical access.

**P_SingleParentHouseholdE**  
ACS Var DP02_0007P + ACS Var DP02_0011P. The percentage of households in a tract that are headed by a single parent.

**total_clinicians**  
The total number of *Internal Medicine* or *Family Practice* doctors within 25km of the census tract. Data was aggregated from **DOCTORS_LOCATIONS**.

### DOCTORS_RAW  
This is an export of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) [National Downloadable File](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/mj5m-pzi6). Please consult the [data dicitionary](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/sites/default/files/data_dictionaries/physician/DOC_Data_Dictionary.pdf) on the CMS Website.

### DOCTORS
A filtered copy of the **DOCTORS_RAW** table, which contains data for only *Internal Medicine* and *Family Practice* clinicians.

### DOCTORS_LOCATIONS
Contains the geocoded locations of all practices from the **DOCTORS** table.

**adrs_id**  
Unique identifier for the address of the practice.

**org_pac_id**  
Unique identifer for the practice organization. Is NULL for individual private practice clinicians (since they are not part of an organization)

**npi**  
Unique identifier for individual private practice clinicians. Is NULL for organizations.

**provider_name**  
Name of the practice organization or private practice clinician.

**address**  
Practice address in the following format: addr_ln_1, cty, st, zip

**ln_2_sprs**  
Field indicating if the addr_ln_2 is unreliable.

**num_clinicians**  
Either the sum of all *Internal Medicine* or *Family Practice* clinicians in the specified organization. Or 1 for a individual private practice clinician.

**lat**  
The WGS84 (EPSG 4326) latitude of the practice.

**lon**  
The WGS84 (EPSG 4326) longitude of the practice.

### TRACT_GEOMETRIES

## Accessing the Demo App (Conda)
To utilize the app, please adhere to the following steps:

1. Download the [Dataset Build](https://github.com/MuelMart/Medical-Deserts/tree/main/Dataset%20Build) folder of this repo. This is the package for the app.
2. Extract package contents locally.
3. Make sure you have an installation of [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) on your machine.
4. Open the anaconda prompt, and change the directory to the folder containing the app package contents. `cd Path/To/My/Directory`
5. Paste the following into the anaconda prompt: `conda env create -f AppEnv.yml`. This will install the package dependencies to execute the app.
6. Paste the following into the anaconda prompt: `conda activate AppEnv`. This will activate the environment for use with the app.
7. Once the environment is created, paste the following into the anaconda prompt: `streamlit run app.py demo`. This will launch a demo version of the app.
8. If you have already installed the environment from step 5, you can start from step 6 for running the app in the future.

## Accessing the Demo App (Pip)
If you encounter dependency issues in the above step, you can manually install the packages to your local python installation to run the app.

1. Download the [Dataset Build](https://github.com/MuelMart/Medical-Deserts/tree/main/Dataset%20Build) folder of this repo. This is the package for the app.
2. Extract package contents locally.
3. Open the command line, and change the directory to the folder containing the app package contents. `cd Path/To/My/Directory`
4. OPTIONAL: Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv AppEnv`, then activate it according to your operating system's [specifications](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
5. Paste the following into the command line: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install the package dependencies to execute the app.
6. Once the environment is created, paste the following into the command line: `streamlit run app.py demo`. This will launch a demo version of the app.
